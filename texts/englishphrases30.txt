How was your first working week?
Everything all right?
Everything all right.
You have a tired appearance.
Yes, I am a little tired.
Let's go drink something.
OK.
Are you hungry?
No, I lunched well.
Can I buy you a drink.
OK, thanks.
What do you want?
I will take a beer.
I would like wine.
You are very beautiful today.
You should not flirt with me!
Why?
Because we work together.
And you are my boss.
In Ukraine this is normal.
But you already have a girlfriend!
No, I don't have one.
But Maryana is your girlfriend, no?
Oy!  No!  She is simply my friend.
We are schoolmates.
I didn't know.
John told me that she is your girlfriend.
No, he is wrong.
Maryanna loves John.
Oy!  Then you can flirt with me.
Do you want to dance with me?
Let's go!
